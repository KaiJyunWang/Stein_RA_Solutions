\section*{Preface}
This document contains my solutions to the exercises in 
\textit{Real Analysis: Measure Theory, Integration, and 
Hilbert Spaces (Princeton Lectures in Analysis)} by 
Elias M. Stein and Rami Shakarchi. Some of the theorems
that are used in the solutions while not explicitly proved 
are taken from the book. Also, some of the theorem are used 
but not explicitly stated in the book. In such cases, the 
proofs are provided in Appendix, as it would be prolix to 
present the proofs in the exercises. Finally, the solutions 
may contain errors and hence should be taken with caution.
